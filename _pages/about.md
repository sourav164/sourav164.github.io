Hi! I am Abdullah Sourav, a graduate student at Iowa State University and working with Dr. Joshua Peschel. I was born and raised at a small village of norther part of Bangladesh. Along with enjoying plenty of cricket and football (soccer), I made my way to Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University where I earned Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering. Before pursuing my Master's in Water Resources Development at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, I had the oppurtunity to work on irrigation manage and water quality monitoring. In my master's thesis, my research focused on mapping flood with GIS and RS technology and asses the impact of the flash flood on rice production. Upon sucessfull completion of M.Sc., I joined Iowa State Univerity to pursue Ph.D. in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering. In first one and half year of my Ph.D., I was involved in automatic tree detection and counting by leveraging the free google earth imegery. Three methods were sucessfully implemneted and evaluated. In addition, I had the oppurtunity to work with Dr. Mathew Dar on "Map Based Farming" project. Currently, my research goal is to apply computer vision and image analysis technology to detect anomality in animal behaviors in comfined farm environment.

Apart from doing research, I actively play Cricket for the Iowa State University team "Cyclone Cricket" and occasionally play Badminton with my friends. I also love to travel with my beautiful wife Rumpa.

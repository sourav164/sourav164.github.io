Hi! I am Abdullah Sourav, a graduate student at Iowa State University and working with Dr. Joshua Peschel. I was born and raised at a small village of norther part of Bangladesh. Along with enjoying plenty of cricket and football (soccer), I made my way to Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University where I earned my Bachelor in Agricultural Engineering. Before pursuing my Master's in Water Resources Development at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, I had the oppurtunity to work on irrigation manage and water quality monitoring. 

My research goal is to apply computer vision and image analysis technology to detect anomality in animal behaviors in comfined farm environment.
